# Introduction and goals

This chapter gives you an overview about the goals of the service, in which context the service runs and which stakeholders are involved.

## Requirements overview

### What is the Item Relationship Service Debugging View?

The IRS-DV is a:

- Web-frontend to visualize an IRS Job to detect errors and failures in the job
- Uses API endpoint to retrieve the tree structures in a recursive way, which data assets are distributed throughout the Catena-X network
- Reference implementation

### Substantial Features

- provide a top-down BoM asBuilt tree structure along the submodel "AssemblyPartRelationship"
- usage of IRS Jobs endpoint for communicating with the Catena-X network

## Quality goals

The following table entries define overall IRS-DV quality goals. The order of the topics do not resolve in a priority of the quality goals.

| Quality goal                  | Motivation and description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| running reference application | The IRS-DV is built to visualize completed IRS-Jobs. The IRS-DV release scope aims to build a running solution to display a job as a tree of nodes, with an highlight on failing nodes.                           |
| cloud agnostic solution       | The IRS-DV is built as reference architecture and able to run on different cloud solutions. It uses helm charts, terraform and a abstracts the storage, so that it can easily be integrated on different systems. |
| base security measures        | The IRS-DV is built with a base set of security features. The program can only be used by logging in via Keyclock                                                                                                 |
| application reliability       | The IRS-DV architecture is set up so that the costumers can rely on reliable data chains                                                                                                                          |

# System scope and context

The IRS-DV acts as a middleware between consumers and manufacturers. This section describes the environment of IRS-DV. Who are its users, and with which other systems does it interact with.

## Business context

![business context overview](./images/puml-svg/business-context.svg)

### Consumer

The consumer is end user who is searching and looking for a errors in all data chain of the Catena-X network. He need to get valid credentials issued by the Catena-X IAM.

### Catena-X network

The IRS-DV retrieves data from the Catena-X network (using the necessary infrastructure, see Technical Context), aggregates it and provides it back to the consumers. This connection is mandatory. If the Catena-X services are unavailable, the IRS-DV cannot perform any work.

## Technical context

![technical context](./images/puml-svg/technical-context.svg)

## Component overview

### IRS-API

We use a REST API that is made by IRS team and can be used by any system registered in the Catena-X Keycloak. For communication we use HTTP(S) protocol.

### IRS-DV system

The IRS-DV system is created to search and show all related components of searched element by globalAssetId and other parameters.

## Technology

The IRS-DV is developed using React framework. This choice was made due to the technical knowledge of the team and the widespread support of the framework.

Hosting the application is done using Docker and Kubernetes, which is widely used and vendor-independent regarding the hosting provider (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, …​).

Communication is done using HTTP. This is the standard method in the Catena-X landscape and makes the IRS API easy to use.

## Structure

The IRS-DV consists of 3 main views:

1. the IRS API to view/find Jobs (services component)
2. the job list
3. the visualization and tombstones blocks

IRS-DV search by parameters in IRS API, and collecting fetched data in job list.

The job list is the place where IRS-DV is storing all fetched jobs and hold search history.

The visualization show us/consumer how elements are connected each other, and tombstones show in what level data is missing.

# Runtime view

This section covers the main processes of the IRS-DV.

## Overall

This section describes the overall flow of the IRS-DV.

![IRS flow](./images/puml-svg/irs-dv-flow.svg)

## Scenario 1: Find a job

This section describes what happens when user search for a job.

create job (IAMGE)

### Overview

User run application locally and select environment. After user select environment and login thought Keycloak user can fill parameters to section and search for a job. If job is found, user will saw it in "Job list". If user cancel Job search it will shows in a "Job list". After Job search is completed user will see it in a "Job list" as "COMPLETED" and can open to overview the job.

**ArgoCD**

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. See https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/.

**Vault**

HashiCorp Vault stores credentials, which are picked up by ArgoCD to deploy them to the application.

Every secret information needed at runtime must be stored here and must never be part of the IRS Helm charts

**GitHub**

GitHub contains the application source code as well as the Helm charts used for deployment. The IRS Helm charts can be found here: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/item-relationship-service/tree/main/charts

## Local deployment

For information on how to run the application locally, please check the README documentation in GitHub: https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/item-relationship-service/blob/main/README.md

## View Levels

## Level 0 - Cluster overview

### Isolated environment

The isolated environment contains the IRS as well as the surrounding services, excluding the external IAM.

### Integrated environment

The integrated environment contains the IRS and is integrated with the rest of the Catena-X network.

integrated (IMAGE)

## Level 1 - IRS application

This section focuses only on the IRS itself, detached from its neighbors. It shows the resources deployed in Kubernetes for the IRS.

irs resources (IMAGE)
**Pod**

This is the actual IRS Docker image which runs as a container. The ports are only available internally and can be opened up with the Service.

**Secrets**

The secret information (e.g. connection credentials) is stored here and provided to the Pod at runtime.

**Service**

The service resource opens up selected ports of the Pod so that other applications in the same cluster can access it or to be used by the Ingress.

**Ingress**

The ingress uses a reverse proxy to provide specified Service ports to the internet under a specified URL. This make the IRS API publicly available.

# Cross-cutting concepts

## Domain concepts

### Domain model

![Domain model](./images/puml-svg/domain-model.svg)

### JobStatus

A job can be in one of the following states:

| State     | Description                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| INITIAL   | The job was stored by the system and is now queued for processing.              |
| RUNNING   | The job is currently being processed.                                           |
| COMPLETED | The job has completed. See the job response for details on the data.            |
| CANCELED  | The job could not be processed, user canceled request                           |
| ERROR     | The job could not be processed correctly by the IRS due to a technical problem. |

### Job Response Datamodel

![job response data model](./images/puml-svg/job-response-datamodel.svg)

## Safety and security concepts

### Authentication / Authorization

### IRS API

The IRS-DV accesses the Catena-X network via the EDC consumer connector (Keycloak).
System are using RESTful calls over HTTP(S). Where central authentication is required, a common Keycloak instance is used. We are only using "GET" protocol from API.

## Credentials

Credentials must never be stored in Git!

## "Under-the-hood" concepts

### Exception and error handling

There are two types of potential errors in the IRS:

### Technical errors

Technical errors occur when there is a problem with the API itself.

### Functional errors

Functional errors occur when there is a problem with the data that is being processed or external systems are unavailable and data cannot be sent / fetched as required for the process. While the system might not be able to provide the required function at that moment, it may work with a different dataset or as soon as the external systems recover.

## Development concepts

### Build, test, deploy

The IRS-DV is built using React and utilizes all the standard concepts of it. Test execution is part of the build process and a minimum test coverage of 80% is enforced.

```
TODO: Add info about Helm chart
```

Although the Docker image can be deployed in various ways, the standard solution are the provided Helm charts, which describe the required components as well.

## Operational concepts

### Configuration - Helm Chart

The most relevant config properties are exposed as environment variables and must be set in the Helm chart so the application can run at all. Check the IRS Helm chart in Git for all available variables.

# Quality requirements

The quality scenarios in this section depict the fundamental quality goals as well as other required quality properties. They allow the evaluation of decision alternatives.

- Quality attribute: A characteristic of software, or a generic term applying to quality factors, quality subfactors, or metric values.

- Quality factor: A management-oriented attribute of software that contributes to its quality.

- Quality subfactor: A decomposition of a quality factor or quality subfactor to its technical components.

- Metric value: A metric output or an element that is from the range of a metric.

- Software quality metric: A function whose inputs are software data and whose output is a single numerical value that can be interpreted as the degree to which software possesses a given attribute that affects its quality.

**Source**: IEEE standard 1061 “Standard for a Software Quality Metrics Methodology”

## List of requirements

This section will be filled soon.
